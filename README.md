backend  fullnclear goal oriend

Ran 3 commands, read 2 files

I've reviewed the full zip. Here's a clean, goal-oriented summary you can hand straight to Codex/VS Code so it builds a frontend that matches this backend exactly — no guessing on its part.

Backend Summary for Frontend Development

What the backend does (one sentence)

A patient uploads one lab report image → the backend runs it through 4 chained AI agents → returns one JSON object containing the extracted values, plain-language explanation, urgency level, and a suggested doctor appointment.

The ONE API endpoint that matters

POST http://localhost:8000/api/process

Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body: file = the uploaded image (JPEG, PNG, or WEBP only)

Health check (useful to verify backend is alive):

GET http://localhost:8000/api/health  →  {"status": "ok"}

Note: current frontend hardcodes http://localhost:8000 — this needs to change to a Codespaces-forwarded URL or an environment-based config if you're not running both on the same machine/port setup.

Exact JSON shape returned by /api/process

  "extraction": {

    "values": [

      {

        "test_name": "Hemoglobin",

        "value": "10.2",

        "unit": "g/dL",

        "reference_range": "12.0–15.5",

        "flag": "low"

      }

        "next_step": "..."

      }

    ],

      "time": "10:00 AM",

      "hospital_type": "government"

    },

    "reason": "..."

  }

}

flag is always one of: normal, high, low, unknown. urgency is always one of: Routine, Needs Attention, Urgent. hospital_type is always government or private.

Error responses to handle in the UI

Status	When	What to show user

400	Wrong file type, or empty file	"Please upload a JPEG, PNG, or WEBP image"

422	No values could be extracted (blurry/bad photo)	"Could not read this report clearly. Try a clearer photo."

500	Any agent in the pipeline crashed	"Something went wrong processing your report. Please try again."

What already exists in frontend/index.html (520 lines)

There's already a styled single-page frontend with a design system in place — teal/green color scheme, CSS variables for urgency states (--routine, --attention, --urgent with matching backgrounds), a card-based layout, and it already calls fetch(${API_BASE}/api/process) with FormData. Don't start from scratch — extend this file. The animated "agent progress" steps mentioned in the README are a timed animation, not real per-agent streaming (the backend returns one blob after all 4 agents finish).

Exact prompt to give Codex

I have an existing frontend/index.html for a project called Sehat Sahulat. 

It's a single HTML file (no build step) that already has CSS styling and 

calls a backend at http://localhost:8000/api/process via a POST request 

with FormData containing an image file.

The backend returns this exact JSON shape: [paste the JSON shape above]

I need you to:

1. Review the existing index.html and keep its current visual style

2. Make sure the upload flow correctly sends the image and handles the 

   response matching this exact JSON structure

3. Display: the extracted lab values with color-coded flags (green=normal, 

   red=high, blue=low), the English/Urdu explanation for each abnormal 

   value, an urgency badge (Routine=green, Needs Attention=orange, 

   Urgent=red), and the suggested appointment (doctor name, specialty, 

   date, time, government/private)

4. Handle these error cases gracefully: 400 (bad file type), 422 (couldn't 

   read report), 500 (server error) — show a friendly message for each

5. Make the API_BASE URL configurable at the top of the file instead of 

   hardcoded, since I'm running this in different environments

Don't rewrite the whole file from scratch — extend what's there. Show me 

the diff/changes clearly.

Two things worth flagging to your team before frontend work starts

The image field name matters — backend expects the form field to literally be named file (from File(...) in FastAPI). If the frontend sends a different field name, it'll fail silently with a 422 or 400.

CORS is wide open (allow_origins=["*"]) in the backend — fine for hackathon demo, means frontend can call it from any origin without extra config, so don't waste time debugging CORS errors that aren't actually happening.

One more thing — I noticed your zip includes a backend/.env file with what looks like a real API key inside it. Make sure that file is in .gitignore before anyone pushes this to GitHub, or your key will be exposed publicly.

Backend Spec for Lovable — Paste This Directly

Lovable builds frontends from a description, so give it the full API contract in one shot. Copy everything below into Lovable's prompt box.

Build a frontend for a healthcare app called "Sehat Sahulat" (means 

"Health Made Easy" in Urdu). It connects to an existing backend API — 

here is the full contract:

## Backend Endpoint

POST http://localhost:8000/api/process

- Content-Type: multipart/form-data

- Body: a single file field named "file" (the uploaded image, JPEG/PNG/WEBP)

GET http://localhost:8000/api/health

- Returns {"status": "ok"} — use this to check if backend is reachable

## What the app does

1. User uploads a photo of their lab/medical report

2. User clicks "Analyze Report"

3. Frontend sends the image to POST /api/process

4. Backend takes 10-30 seconds to respond (processing through AI agents)

5. Frontend displays the full result

## Exact JSON response shape from /api/process

{

  "extraction": {

    "values": [

      {

        "test_name": "Hemoglobin",

        "value": "10.2",

        "unit": "g/dL",

        "reference_range": "12.0–15.5",

        "flag": "low"

      }

    ],

    "raw_notes": null

  },

  "interpretation": {

    "items": [

      {

        "test_name": "Hemoglobin",

        "explanation_en": "English explanation text",

        "explanation_ur": "Urdu explanation text",

        "next_step": "Suggested next step text"

      }

    ],

    "disclaimer": "This is not a medical diagnosis. Please consult a doctor for confirmation."

  },

  "urgency": {

    "urgency": "Routine",

    "reasoning": "Short explanation of why this urgency level"

  },

  "scheduling": {

    "chosen_slot": {

      "doctor_name": "Dr. Ayesha Malik",

      "specialty": "General Physician",

      "date": "2026-09-12",

      "time": "10:00 AM",

      "hospital_type": "government"

    },

    "reason": "Why this slot was chosen"

  }

}

Note: "flag" is always one of: normal, high, low, unknown

"urgency" is always one of: Routine, Needs Attention, Urgent

"hospital_type" is always: government or private

## UI Requirements

Screen 1 — Upload screen:

- Clean, calming healthcare design (teal/white color scheme)

- Title: "Sehat Sahulat"

- Subtitle: "Upload your lab report and understand it in simple English & Urdu"

- Image upload box (drag and drop or click to browse)

- Preview the uploaded image before analyzing

- "Analyze Report" button (disabled until an image is uploaded)

Screen 2 — Loading state:

- Show while waiting for the API response (10-30 sec)

- Display 4 sequential steps with checkmarks appearing one at a time to 

  simulate progress: "Reading report..." → "Preparing explanation..." → 

  "Checking urgency..." → "Finding appointment..."

  (Note: this is a visual animation only, since the real backend returns 

  everything in one response — time the checkmarks to appear every few 

  seconds while waiting for the actual API call to finish)

Screen 3 — Results screen, showing in this order:

1. Extracted Values: list each test with a colored dot/icon — green for 

   "normal", red for "high", blue for "low" — showing test name, value, 

   unit, and reference range

2. Explanation: for each abnormal item, show the English explanation and 

   Urdu explanation, with a toggle or side-by-side view to switch between 

   languages

3. Urgency Badge: a colored badge — green="Routine", orange="Needs 

   Attention", red="Urgent" — with the reasoning text below it

4. Suggested Appointment: a card showing doctor name, specialty, date, 

   time, and whether it's government or private, with the reason text

5. Always show this disclaimer at the bottom in muted text: "This is not 

   a medical diagnosis. Please consult a doctor for confirmation."

Screen 3 (continued) — Appointment request form below the results:

- Simple form: Full Name, Phone Number, Preferred Day (dropdown: 

  Tomorrow / This Week / Next Week)

- Submit button — on submit, just show a success message (no real backend 

  call needed for this part, it's a static confirmation for the demo)

## Error handling (show a friendly message, not a raw error)

- If the API returns 400: "Please upload a JPEG, PNG, or WEBP image"

- If the API returns 422: "Could not read this report clearly. Please 

  try a clearer photo."

- If the API returns 500 or the request fails/times out: "Something went 

  wrong processing your report. Please try again."

## Technical notes

- Make the backend URL (currently http://localhost:8000) easy to change 

  in one place, since it will change when deployed

- Use FormData to send the file, with the field name exactly "file"

- The design should feel trustworthy and calm — this is a healthcare app 

  for patients who may be anxious about their results, not a flashy 

  consumer app

After Lovable Generates It

Test locally against your Codespaces backend first — you'll need to update the hardcoded http://localhost:8000 to your Codespaces forwarded port URL (from the Ports tab)

Once both work together, push the Lovable-generated frontend code to your GitHub repo alongside the backend

One thing to flag to your team: Lovable-generated code usually needs a small manual pass to fix the exact backend URL and test the real error cases (upload a blurry photo, a non-image file) — don't assume it works perfectly without testing against your actual running backend

Uh, me ki the UI, the picture I send you where doctor is standing with a nurse. I want the same UI for my project. Uh, like it should be so elegant, so good. But according to my, uh, um, backend, I send you the details of my backend. It should be clean, not generic. It not be like the AI made it. It should be cool and modern. According to the, the UI I send you where doctor is standing, I want such type of UI and where I send you the, uh, first link where, um, a file is attached. Uh, here there should be a box where I can upload-- any patient can upload his, uh, uh, report and then analyze will be, yeah. I want this type of box, but a whole UI not be generic. It should be elegant, cool, and like it should be so, uh, so good. Like, uh, it should not be so generic. It should not be, uh, bad. It should not be like AI made it. It should be cool according to modern Gen Z attractor for hackathon.
